A physic engine based in stochastic movement for education purposes. Any help is welcome :)

Physic engines as Box2D, Bullet or Matter try to simulate common objects behavior, as objects falling or colliding.
They are really useful for games and simple examples to explain forces or dynamic movements. But, I study life, 
I'm a biologist, and life is a bounch of molecules interacting. I need a physic engine that simulate the molecular world.
I think the most elemental rule in the microscopic world are that every object is moving really fast and you can not predict 
what will be its next position, it is an stochastic movement. So, I want to create a physic engine with most of the features of 
those mentioned before, but based not on forces and accelerations but probability of chose a next step in one direction 
or another.
My goal is that this can be use for eductive proposes to explaind key processes of life.
